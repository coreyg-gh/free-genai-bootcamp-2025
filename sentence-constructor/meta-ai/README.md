For the Meta AI prompt testing, the how to guide was consulted.  After testing a number of examples, specific options such as specifying a casual conversion tone and asking for the sentence to be broken down into smaller parts were added.

Also tested in MS CoPilot and the results were very similar to Meta AI.
